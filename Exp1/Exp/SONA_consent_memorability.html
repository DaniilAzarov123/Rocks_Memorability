  <h1>INDIANA UNIVERSITY STUDY INFORMATION SHEET FOR RESEARCH</h1>
  <h2>Using cognitive models to understand memorability of real world images,  21800:<br>VISUAL-OBJECT MEMORY</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>You are being asked to participate in a research study.</strong> Scientists do research to answer important questions that might help change or improve the way we do things in the future. This document will give you information about the study to help you decide whether you want to participate. Please read this form, and ask any questions you have, before agreeing to be in the study.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>All research is voluntary.</strong> You can choose not to take part in this study. If you decide to participate, you can change your mind later and leave the study at any time. You will not be penalized or lose any benefits if you decide not to participate or choose to leave the study later.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>The purpose of this study</strong> is to investigate how people learn to remember and categorize real-world visual objects.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are asking you if you want to be in this study because you self-selected through the PBS subject pool.  The study is being conducted by Dr. R.M. Nosofsky, Indiana University/Psychological and Brain Sciences. It is funded by the Australian Research Council. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you agree to be in the study, you will do the following things.</strong>  You will be making various judgments about objects, such as trying to remember them, grouping them into categories, and judging how similar they are to one another.  The study is conducted online and will last about 45 minutes but less than one hour.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Before agreeing to participate, please consider the risks and potential benefits of taking part in this study.</strong> Except for a possible loss of confidentiality, there are no known risks in taking part in this study.  There is a risk someone outside the study team could get access to your research information from this study.  More information about how we will protect your information to reduce this risk is below.
    </p>
    <p>
        We don’t think you will have any personal benefits from taking part in this study, but we hope to learn things that will help researchers in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>You will not be paid for participating in this study.</strong> You will receive 1 credit for your participation toward an introductory psychology course requirement.  If you do not wish to be in the study you can participate in other PBS SONA studies or you can fulfill your introductory psychology course requirement in other ways established by your course instructor.  
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>We will protect your information</strong> and make every effort to keep your personal information confidential, but we cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality. No information which could identify you will be shared in publications about this study. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Your personal information may be shared outside the research study if required by law. We also may need to share your research records with other groups for quality assurance or data analysis. These groups include the Indiana University Institutional Review Board or its designees, and state or federal agencies who may need to access the research records (as allowed by law).  Information collected in this study may be used for other research studies or shared with other researchers for future research.  If this happens, information that could identify you, such as your name and other identifiers, will be removed before any information is shared.  Since identifying information will be removed, we will not ask for your additional consent.
